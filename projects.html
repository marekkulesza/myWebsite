					Now this story all begins with this ape... and then
					coronavirus happened. Which was one of the best things
					to ever happen to me because I got a lot of time to
					think about what I wanted to do in my life so I learned
					how to code.
				</p>
				<p>
					So this is my first project, I wanted to scrap the title
					off of job posting websites and add them into my resume,
					and onto the file itself. I inadvertently learned a
					lot, one line of code roughly took me 2hrs to get
					through.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project was about 2 months of studying python for
					about an hour each day. I learned a lot about imports
					here and just scraping in general. This was before I
					knew a lot about html but I intuitively knew this from
					past experiences in saving files from websites.

					This was a project based around two main things. #1 this
					project was for hyperskills.org's web development 
					program. #2 I used the skills I learned at Mohawk to
					make myself a little Virtual Piano.
				</p>
				<p>
					The keys can be played to make a sound. Positional
					statements were really tricky here and I learned about
					z-axis which is just layering

					So, this was extremely hard, divs are hard and if I had
					to say anything it makes sense... once you get the hang
					of it. I've made so many mistakes, like so many, I'm
					afraid to check my spelling because the code is even
					worse. But HTML just works... it just keeps on chugging.
				</p>
				<p>
					Balance is the most important part about css. I'm not
					worried about pixel perfection, I'm not even worried
					about my spelling or grammar because there's something
					more important here. Getting those Divs right.
				</p>
				<p>
					There's a lot I learned here, you can have 2 custom CSS
					files. Javascript at the end before the closing body
					tag. Being able to choose different screen sizes when
					you check your elements that you did wrong. Those
					columns and rows at the first page, took me hours. And
					the website that I used to get this awesome theme was
					from Bootswatch (Darkly). Pro tip, if you're ever going
					to use a new piece of tech there's typically a "Getting
					Started" button on the front so you don't have to look
					at terrible youtube videos that are like 4 years old.
					Also having great friends (Petar and McFarland) who can
					help you along the way because flex stuff doesn't seem
					to flex the way you want it to.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alright this is the actual serious part. I used AWS's
					front-end development software called Amplify. Now this
					is a crazy awesome service because you get scalable web
					hosting with tons of cool features like being able to
					see what your app will look like on different devices
					(phones and such), but I ended up using Heroku because
					it was basically the same with a few less features and
					it was free but here's a 6 hour story I had with AWS.
				</p>
				<p>
					AWS's CLI is very difficult for not-smart people to use.
					The syntax is very simple once you get it. Having to
					find your app-id is pretty difficult since it's not
					exactly there in your face saying "HEY APP-ID = this
					value" what I noticed was that in your app's default
					domain is the app id. eg. main."app-id".something.com.
					This took me 4 hours to figure out. I'm not-smart.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now you might be asking, why do you want your app-id.
					Well to delete your app, you need to use the AWS CLI,
					and there isn't a nice little button anywhere to just
					delete your app, because why have that? So when the
					advice is just: delete-app --app-id (value) this means
					nothing to someone who isn't too smart and who now has
					to spend 4 hours looking for their app-id.
				</p>

				<p>
					After you properly get the AWS CLI installed and figure
					that you have to write AWS delete-app --app-id (value),
					then get your auth-key, then get your auth-key password,
					then get your location server, like us-east-2, THEN
					finally you can delete it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Heroku has that little nice delete pipeline button in
					the settings. Thank you Heroku.

					Face Detector in OpenCV

				</h2>
				<p>
					Alright, alright, alright. I get it, You know that meme
					where the guy who just started learning python skipped
					all the way to machine learning. Yea that guy is me.
					This was probably my 2nd real project that I was working
					on while learning how to really read python that wasn't
					my own.
				</p>
				<p>
					The face detector was pretty simple, get some already
					written code from youtube, realize that it actually
					doesn't work so you have to debug that by changing the
					webcam = 1 to webcam = 0, and the end of the program
					where if you pressed Q (yea that doesn't work), replace
					that all with alt-f4. Then try to download OpenCV only
					for that not to work. So that you have to download the
					whole OpenCV package and drop in on your desktop just to
					make it work and if you EVER moved it, nothing would
					work. So you forever have this opencv folder on your
					desktop in the bottom left hoping no one ever asks how
					you installed OpenCV because you're not ready for that
					conversation. But once you get installing every out of
					the way, your code seems to have more errors then
					characters because VScode doesn't know that you somehow
					actually do have OpenCV installed, maybe? But if you run
					the programs they seem to work... so that's pretty cool.
				</p>

				<p>
					So how does this thing actually work? Well its pretty
					simple. Firstly, get your camera working, have it
					display using numpy, depending on how you want to stack
					your video feed (so you can see what the ai is seeing).
					Then you grab the pre-made face cascade file and load it
					into the program, which is made from thousands of
					pictures of faces and thousands more pictures of things
					that sometimes show up around faces so that you create
					positives and negatives (more on that in the next
					project) turned into a XML file that no human can
					actually understand fully. Then add trackbars to the
					program and then from there just run whatever methods
					you want from when it detects the face. Mine didn't have
					this but it can easily be done, just put it in the if
					statement.
				</p>
				<p>
					As of 2020, face detection is pretty old technology, I
					believe 2019-2020 tech is mostly towards deep-fakes
					which is pretty cutting end stuff.

						</button>
					</h2>
					<p>
						So custom object detection is pretty cool but
						probably not something you want to be doing. There's
						a lot to say about when and how you should integrate
						ai. A good example being something that has a low
						cost to failure and something extremely repetitive
						that no one likes doing. So naturally we just put
						them in everything.
					</p>
					<p>
						The main thing to learn at this time was more data
						is better. Ignore the whole over-training part, for
						practical purpose's I've never over-trained my own
						projects I believe, maybe data scientists will say
						ohh this is very easy to over-train, ad they're
						probably right but under-training is a bigger issue
						for someone working with a few hundred photos and a
						1kb xml file.
					</p>
					<p>
						Just creating a simple object detector that looks at
						LED's on a breadboard took me days. The fine tuning
						is insane because you'll be pointing your camera at
						your speakers and it will tell you "I see an LED" so
						you have to spend another 20mins creating a new XML
						file and at the end of what seemed to be a 2 day
						venture because a 2 month project that didn't really
						work unless I had a super stable environment.

					</h2>
					<p>
						This turned out better than you'd think, with QT I
						actually didn't have to do much coding but learn
						what each thing does and accidentally I learned you
						can import entire python files. So now I have a
						python file for the UI and a python file for the
						code.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I grabbed my resume builder program and slapped a
						GUI on it and it turned out pretty good. Having the
						buttons connect to the methods is pretty satisfying.
						It's pretty intuitive. Exporting it to become a
						standalone application didn't work out because one
						dependency wasn't exporting properly.
